Betting game using Chainlink

Decentralized application where a user can bet ether by selecting either high or low (values in dice), and if the user guesses correctly twice the amount of ether will be transferred to the user, otherwise no amount will be returned. Used Chainlink VRF for generating randomness in the smart contract. Deployed the dapp in Rinkeby test network.
